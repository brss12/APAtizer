# Description
APAtizer is a tool designed to analyse alternative polyadenylation of TCGA RNA-Seq data. Additionally, it is capable of performing differential gene expression, gene ontology analysis, visualizing Venn diagram intersections and pearson correlation analysis. APAtizer is equipped to handle TCGA files, such as BAM files, sample sheets, clinical data from patients and downstream analysis files such as htseq and DaPars txt files. It is a user-friendly interface, that allows users with limited knowledge on bioinformatics to generate informative visualizations, including Volcano plots, heatmaps and gene lists. The APAtizer tool also provides the functionality to download the aforementioned plots and gene lists for further analysis and exploration.

# Installing dependencies
To install the required dependencies for the creation of the input files for APAtizer, the user must run the [install_dependencies.sh](install_dependencies.sh) script.
```shell
./install_dependencies.sh
```

# Creating the input files
To start, clone the repository in the same directory where your raw BAM files are located. The script [APAtizer_inputs.smk](APAtizer_inputs.smk) employs the snakemake workflow to create fastqc reports, sort and remove the duplicates from the raw TCGA BAM files required for the APA analysis step using the APAlyzer algorithm and creates the Dapars files required for APA analysis employing the DaPars2 algorithm. In addition, it also creates the htseq files required for differential gene expression analysis using the DESeq2 package.

The script requires the raw BAM files to be placed in a folder called **RAW_BAM** and, upon running, creates two new folders called **SORTED_BAM** and **TRIMMED_READS**. In the **SORTED_BAM** folder, is where the sorted bam files along with fastqc reports are placed and in the **TRIMMED_READS** is where the de-duplicated bam files along with fastqc reports are placed. After this, a folder called **DaPars_data** is created with the final DaPars txt files.

Depending on the size and ammount of BAM files, we recommend running the script in a HPC environment. Run the script on the same directory of the **RAW_BAM** folder with the following command. 
```shell
nohup bash -c "snakemake -s APAtizer_inputs.smk --cores 1 --jobs 1 --wait-for-files" &
```

***All done! Now you are ready to use APAtizer!***

# APAtizer walkthrough
In the walkthrough of the APAtizer tool, a case study using 46 samples (23 Normal Tissue samples and 23 Primary Tumor samples) from colorectal cancer from TCGA was performed to showcase the interface and the capabilities of the tool all while retrieving useful insights from the data.

To run the tool, the user must run the R script [APAtizer.R](APAtizer.R) using the following command.
```shell
Rscript APAtizer.R
```
Upon running the command, all the R packages needed for APAtizer will be installed automatically and a link to the tool will appear in the end. Click said link to open APAtizer in your default web browser!
The user can also open the R script in Rstudio and then click on the ***Run App*** button to launch the tool in a separate window.

In this section, the user only needs to select the list of genes in which he wants to perform gene ontology exploration and the type of analysis to be performed, *Biological Process (BP)* and *Molecular Function (MF)*. The provided list should be one of the gene lists obtained in the previous steps (DaPars, APAlyzer or DGE analysis).

The output space only has one tab called *GO Plots* in which the resulting plots are displayed and can be downloaded.

For the Venn diagram intersections, the user can provide up to 5 gene lists obtained in the previous steps to execute the analysis. In the output section, the Venn diagram is displayed and can be downloaded in the tab *Venn Diagram*. Next, the user can obtain and download a list of the common genes between all the gene lists provided in the intersection.

## APA CORRELATION ANALYSIS interface

In this section we can see the pearson correlation analysis scatter plot between the 3'UTR APA and DGE events. In this case study for colon cancer we can see that genes that undergo 3'UTR APA shortening events are being upregulated and the genes that undergo 3'UTR APA lengthening events are being downregulated.

## IPA CORRELATION ANALYSIS interface

Now, in this section we have the pearson correlation analysis scatter plot between IPA and DGE events. For colon cancer, we can also see that we have a significant negative correlation between IPA and DGE events. Genes that undergo IPA downregulation are being more expressed, whereas genes that undergo IPA upregulation are being less expressed.

# Final remarks
In this README, a case study for colon cancer (COAD) from the TCGA repository was used to demonstrate and explain the features and capabilities of the APAtizer tool. With this tool, the user can analyze RNA-Seq data from TCGA and retrieve many plots and useful information regarding 3'UTR APA & IPA events via DaPars2 and APAlyzer analysis, the function of those genes via gene ontology analysis, the common genes between cancers using venn diagram intersections and the correlation between 3'UTR APA & IPA events and DGE via pearson correlation analysis scatter plots.
